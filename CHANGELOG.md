## [0.0.1] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- Scaffolded the `ms-markets` Python project with the import package `msm`.
- Added MkDocs documentation, ADRs, tutorial scaffold, and GitHub Pages
  deployment workflow.
- Migrated market-domain code from the SDK into `src/msm`.
- Migrated market-domain examples into `examplezs/`.
- Migrated market-domain agent skills into `.agents/skills/`.
- Added a future CLI package scaffold under `src/cli`.
- Added the initial `docs/knowledge` concept documentation area for `msm`
  package concepts.
- Added Apache-2.0 licensing metadata and the full project license.
- Added the `.agents/skills/library_maintenance` Open Agent skill to enforce
  library maintenance workflows across implementation, documentation, examples,
  tutorials, changelog, and validation.

### Changed

- Moved asset DataNode schemas from the obsolete `msm.assets` package boundary
  into `msm.data_nodes.assets`.
- Moved OpenFIGI provider helpers into `msm.services.assets.openfigi` and kept
  asset identity on the `msm.models.assets.Asset` MetaTable model.
- Made `msm.services` and `msm.data_nodes` package exports lazy so provider
  helpers and lightweight package imports do not initialize unrelated platform
  dependencies.
- Reworked the README into the public project overview, including logo, badges,
  documentation map, quick start, development commands, metadata, and license
  information.
- Made README links PyPI-safe by pointing package-page readers to the public
  documentation site and GitHub project files.
- Added explicit source distribution include rules so PyPI source artifacts do
  not ship local IDE, workflow, or agent-maintenance files.
- Refactored instrument valuation code into `msm.pricing`.
- Renamed pricing model helpers from the old `pricing_models` package to
  `msm.pricing.models`.

### Removed

- Removed migrated market-domain code, examples, and skills from the SDK tree.
